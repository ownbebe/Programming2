Creating a User Interface 1: CSC 372-CTA3

Project Purpose: develop a simple JavaFx GUI

Program inputs: System date and time

Program outputs: Date and time to text field, date and time to file, and color hue

Program limitations: Was not able to run on my Eclipse IDE, but that could be from user error. NetBeans IDE was used for the development of this project.

Program errors: The random hue of green has the chance to not be primarily green*/
